# Tetraploid Dosage Inference from REF/ALT Read Counts

This repository contains a Python script for inferring allele dosage genotypes in autotetraploid potato from sequencing-derived REF/ALT read counts.

The script implements a modified naïve binomial dosage-calling approach on the log-likelihood scale. It is designed for biallelic SNP data where each sample genotype is represented as a read-count string such as `39/0`, `79/25`, or `52/52`.

The method is intended to provide a fast, transparent, and practical genotype-calling approach for high-confidence dosage-aware analysis in tetraploid potato breeding populations.

## Overview

In an autotetraploid organism, a biallelic SNP can occur in five possible dosage states.

In this script:

- `A` represents the reference allele.
- `B` represents the alternate allele.
- Dosage refers to the number of ALT allele copies.

| ALT dosage | Genotype | Expected REF fraction | Expected ALT fraction |
|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | `AAAA` | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| 1 | `AAAB` | 0.75 | 0.25 |
| 2 | `AABB` | 0.50 | 0.50 |
| 3 | `ABBB` | 0.25 | 0.75 |
| 4 | `BBBB` | 0.00 | 1.00 |

For each SNP and sample, the script uses the observed REF and ALT read counts to estimate the most likely dosage class.

Only genotype calls with normalized probability greater than or equal to the user-defined confidence threshold are reported. The default threshold is `0.95`.

## Key features

- Infers tetraploid dosage genotypes from `REF/ALT` read-count data.
- Supports the five expected autotetraploid dosage classes: `AAAA`, `AAAB`, `AABB`, `ABBB`, and `BBBB`.
- Uses log binomial likelihoods for numerical stability.
- Avoids underflow in high-depth sequencing data using log-scale calculations and `logsumexp`.
- Includes a small sequencing-error term to handle near-homozygous sites.
- Reports only high-confidence genotype calls.
- Allows user-defined error and confidence thresholds.
- Handles missing or malformed values safely.
- Removes duplicated marker positions based on the metadata columns.
- Produces a clean CSV output suitable for downstream genetic analysis.

## Input format

The input file should be a comma-separated CSV file.

The first two columns are treated as marker metadata. For example:

```text
Chromosome,Position
```

All remaining columns are assumed to contain sample-level REF/ALT read counts.

Example input:

```csv
Chromosome,Position,Sample_1,Sample_2,Sample_3,Sample_4
ST4.03ch01,12345,39/0,79/25,52/52,0/39
ST4.03ch01,67890,3036/56,25/79,40/3,./.
```

Each genotype cell should be formatted as:

```text
REF/ALT
```

Examples:

```text
39/0
79/25
52/52
25/79
0/39
3036/56
```

Missing or malformed values such as the following are treated as missing data:

```text
.
NA
NaN
nan
./.
empty cells
malformed strings
negative read counts
```

---

## Output format

The output file is a CSV containing the original metadata columns followed by inferred genotype calls for each sample.

Example output:

```csv
Chromosome,Position,Sample_1,Sample_2,Sample_3,Sample_4
ST4.03ch01,12345,AAAA (99.99%),AAAB (99.99%),AABB (99.99%),BBBB (99.99%)
ST4.03ch01,67890,AAAA (99.99%),ABBB (99.99%),Low confidence,No reads
```

Possible output labels include:

| Output label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AAAA (xx.xx%)` | Confident genotype call with normalized probability |
| `AAAB (xx.xx%)` | Confident genotype call with normalized probability |
| `AABB (xx.xx%)` | Confident genotype call with normalized probability |
| `ABBB (xx.xx%)` | Confident genotype call with normalized probability |
| `BBBB (xx.xx%)` | Confident genotype call with normalized probability |
| `Low confidence` | Best genotype probability is below the confidence threshold |
| `No reads` | Missing, malformed, or zero-depth genotype information |

Duplicated marker rows are removed using the first two metadata columns. Only the first occurrence is retained.

## Method

For each sample at each SNP, the script extracts the REF and ALT read counts:

```text
n = REF + ALT
```

where:

- `REF` is the number of reads supporting the reference allele.
- `ALT` is the number of reads supporting the alternate allele.
- `n` is the total read depth.

The model evaluates the likelihood of observing the REF read count under each of the five tetraploid dosage classes.

The expected REF fractions are:

```text
AAAA: 1.00
AAAB: 0.75
AABB: 0.50
ABBB: 0.25
BBBB: 0.00
```

A small sequencing-error term is used:

```text
error = 0.001
```

The homozygous classes are modelled as:

```text
AAAA: p_ref = 1 - error
BBBB: p_ref = error
```

The heterozygous classes are modelled using a symmetric two-component mixture around the expected REF fraction:

```text
0.5 × Binomial(p = f + error) + 0.5 × Binomial(p = f - error)
```

where `f` is the expected REF fraction for the genotype class.

All likelihoods are calculated on the log scale using the binomial log-probability mass function:

```text
log P(k | n, p)
```

where:

- `k` is the observed REF read count,
- `n` is the total read depth,
- `p` is the expected REF probability for a given genotype class.

The script then normalizes the log-likelihoods across all five genotype classes using `logsumexp`, generating posterior-like probabilities.

The genotype with the highest normalized probability is selected as the best call.

If the best probability is greater than or equal to the confidence threshold, the genotype is reported. Otherwise, the genotype is labelled as `Low confidence`.

## Why log-likelihoods are used

Direct binomial probabilities can become extremely small when read depth is high. This can lead to numerical underflow, especially for large sequencing datasets or sites with extreme allele ratios.

To avoid this issue, the script calculates genotype likelihoods on the log scale using:

```python
lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(k + 1) - lgamma(n - k + 1)
+ k * log(p) + (n - k) * log(1 - p)
```

This approach is stable for:

- low-depth sites,
- high-depth sites,
- near-homozygous sites,
- extreme REF/ALT ratios,
- and large sequencing datasets.

Because of this log-scale implementation, the script does not need to switch to a normal approximation for high-depth sites.

## Assumptions and limitations

This script assumes:

1. The organism is autotetraploid.
2. SNPs are biallelic.
3. Input values are REF/ALT read counts.
4. The five genotype classes follow expected tetraploid dosage ratios.
5. All genotype classes are treated with equal prior probability.
6. The sequencing error term is small and symmetric.
7. The confidence value is a normalized likelihood-based probability rather than a fully Bayesian posterior with external priors.

The script does not explicitly model:

- allele-specific mapping bias,
- overdispersion,
- population structure,
- genotype priors,
- parental genotype constraints,
- or site-specific sequencing error.

For more complex genotype calling, especially in low-depth or highly biased datasets, specialized polyploid genotype callers such as `updog` may provide a more detailed probabilistic framework.

However, for high-depth datasets with reliable REF/ALT counts, this simplified method provides a transparent and computationally efficient alternative.

## Recommended methods description

The following text can be used or adapted for a manuscript methods section:

> Allele dosage was inferred using a modified naïve binomial model based on REF and ALT read counts. For each SNP and sample, the log-likelihood of the observed REF read count was calculated under five autotetraploid dosage classes: AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, and BBBB. Homozygous classes were modelled using error-adjusted REF probabilities of 1 − e and e, whereas heterozygous classes were modelled using a symmetric two-component mixture around the expected REF fraction. Likelihoods were calculated on the log scale and normalized across genotype classes using the log-sum-exp transformation to obtain posterior-like probabilities. Genotype calls were retained only when the highest normalized probability was greater than or equal to 0.95.
